# kenportfolio

## Description
I created a new repo named kenportfolio and cloned it to my bootcamp folder in Github using terminal. 

HTML:
In html I created a index with a href to my style.css file. In the body of my html I created a header that included click buttons that allows the user to navigate to different areas of the page. The main content of the page included a picture of me and a brief description of myself. I also included a photo of some previous work I have completed in the bootcamp and when the photo is clicked it takes the user to that site.

CSS:
In css I used flexbox to organize and put my content in the ares I wanted them on the page. I used borders and various colors to decorate the page. I used the hover code to show when I hovered over my navigation bar and previous work image. I also used media queries to make my context fit to screen when using different devices to view the page.
